# **AI Chatbot Impact on Customer Support - Data Analysis & Visualization**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes **customer support ticket data** to evaluate the potential impact of **AI chatbots** on **resolution rates, response times, customer satisfaction, and cost savings**. The analysis includes **data cleaning, AI-driven projections, and visualizations** to support decision-making for AI adoption in customer support.

## **Key Findings**
- **AI chatbots could improve ticket closure rates** from **33% to ~67%**.
- **AI reduces resolution time** from **7.59 hours to ~3.80 hours**.
- **Projected cost savings:** ~$38,940 per month.
- **Customer satisfaction score projected to increase** from **2.99 to 3.44**.

## **Data Analysis Process**
### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Converted timestamps to **datetime format**.
- Identified and **removed invalid timestamps** where resolution time was before response time.
- Calculated **ticket resolution duration** in hours.

### **2. AI Projections**
- Applied **industry benchmarks** for AI chatbot performance.
- **Closure rate increase:** From **33% â†’ 67%**.
- **Time reduction:** AI reduces resolution time by **50%**.

### **3. Cost Savings Analysis**
- Assumed **$5 per human-handled ticket** and **$0.60 per AI-handled ticket**.
- AI-driven support estimated to save **~$38,940 per month**.

### **4. Visualizations & Insights**
- **Bar charts comparing current vs. AI closure rates, resolution times, and cost savings.**
